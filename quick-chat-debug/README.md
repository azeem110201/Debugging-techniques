We built our own new Chat Application called QuickChat. The basic functionalities of sending messages and receiving them are working. However,

1: Users are unable to enter the chat window.

2: Also, when a user tries to enter the chat app by entering his/her name, the app does not recognise the user, meaning, it does not say “Rakesh has entered the chat.”, but it says, ”undefined has entered the chat.”

Fix it quickly.

## To setup the project:
    clone the repo 
    use npm install
    use npm run
