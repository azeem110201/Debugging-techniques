 ## debugging scenario
 
      We have developed a chat application where based on the chat room selected, 
      the users can listen to or send messages to the other users. 
      Everything works fine with chat room 1. But if chat room 2 is selected, 
      all the other users in the same chat room are receiving two messages for each message being sent. 
      Can you please help in solving this problem?
